# ChurchPad Notes Blueprint

## Overview

ChurchPad Notes is a Flutter-based note-taking application designed for church members and attendees. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for creating, managing, and organizing notes, with a focus on features relevant to a church setting, such as bible lookup and sermon notes. The application leverages Firebase for backend services, including authentication and data storage.

## Style and Design

The application follows a clean and modern design aesthetic, with a focus on usability and readability.

*   **Typography:** The app uses the "Lato" font from Google Fonts, providing a clean and legible text style.
*   **Color Scheme:** The primary color scheme is based on a seed color of `#2563EB`, a vibrant blue, with a light and airy theme.
*   **Layout:** The layout is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, with a bottom navigation bar for switching between a user's primary views.
