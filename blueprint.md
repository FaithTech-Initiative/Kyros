# Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the plan and progress for creating a note-taking application. It will serve as a guide for development, tracking features, and documenting architectural decisions.

## Current State

- **Fixed "Invalid image data" error:** Replaced the network image for the Google logo on the authentication screen with a local asset. This resolves the `Invalid image data` exception and makes the screen more robust, especially in offline or poor network conditions.
- **Resolved dependency conflicts:** Addressed a `flutter pub get` failure by downgrading the `flutter_quill` package to a compatible version, ensuring that all project dependencies are correctly resolved.

## Implemented Features

- **Note-taking functionality:** Users can create, edit, and save notes.
- **Rich text editing:** The `flutter_quill` package is used for rich text editing capabilities.
- **Local database:** Notes are stored locally using a database.

## Next Steps

- **Investigate network errors:** The persistent network errors need to be addressed to ensure that the application can reliably connect to Firebase services.
- **Enhance UI:** Improve the user interface for a better user experience.
- **Add more features:** Consider adding features like categories, search, and reminders.
