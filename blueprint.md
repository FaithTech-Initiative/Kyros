### Current Plan: Bible Reference Lookup

Our next goal is to implement a Bible reference lookup tool. This will allow users to easily search for and link Bible verses within their notes.

#### Steps:

1.  **Add a Bible API:** We will integrate a Bible API to fetch scripture content.
2.  **Create a Search UI:** We will design a user-friendly search interface for finding verses.
3.  **Link to Notes:** We will implement the functionality to link the searched verses to the user's notes.
