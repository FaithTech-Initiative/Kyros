# ChurchPad App Blueprint

## Overview

A note-taking application for church members, allowing them to take notes during services, Bible studies, and other events. The app is built with Flutter and uses Firebase for backend services.

## Features

- **Note-taking:** Create, edit, and view notes.
- **Firestore Integration:** Notes are saved and retrieved from a Firestore database.
- **Bible Verse Lookup:** Search for and add Bible verses to notes using an external API.
- **Favorites:** Mark notes as favorites.
- **Search:** Search for notes by title.
- **Grid/List View:** Toggle between grid and list views for notes.

## Current Plan

- The application is in a good state. I will now wait for further instructions from the user.
